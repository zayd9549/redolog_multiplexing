## üîÅ Redo Log Multiplexing

---

### üìò What Are Redo Logs?

Redo logs store **all changes made to the database**, helping in **instance recovery** in case of crash or failure. These are critical for **data durability and integrity**.

---

### üßæ What Redo Logs Contain

Redo logs capture **every change made to data** at a **low level**, such as:

* üìù **DML changes** ‚Äî `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* üîß **DDL operations** ‚Äî `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER INDEX`, etc.
* üß± **Undo data** ‚Äî rollback data for uncommitted transactions
* üì¶ **Transaction control** ‚Äî markers for `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`
* üîÑ **Data dictionary changes** ‚Äî system metadata updates
* üìö **Temporary tablespace activity** (during recovery if used)

> ‚úÖ Redo logs **do NOT record `SELECT` statements** ‚Äî only **modifications** to data

---

### üß© Redo Log Structure

* A **Redo Log Group** = one or more **Redo Log Members**
* Each **group** is written **in parallel** to all its members
* Oracle reuses groups in **circular fashion** üîÑ

> ‚ùóRedo logs are **vital for crash recovery**. Keeping them on a single disk = single point of failure!

---

### üîÑ Circular Working Mechanism

    style C fill:#fbeee6,stroke:#d35400,stroke-width:2px
```

üåÄ Oracle continuously **cycles through redo log groups** ‚Äî it writes to the `CURRENT` group, then switches in sequence.

---

### üîí Why Multiplex Redo Logs?

To avoid **data loss or corruption** in case of disk or file failures.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Multiplexing:

* Reduces chance of losing redo data
* Continues operation even if one member is corrupted
* Recommended by Oracle in **all production environments**

### üß† Redo Log Statuses (`V$LOG`)

| Status     | Meaning                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `CURRENT`  | Group actively being written to üü¢             |
| `ACTIVE`   | Still needed for recovery, not reusable yet üü° |
| `INACTIVE` | Archived and **safe to drop** ‚ö´                |

üîç Check log group statuses:

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only `INACTIVE` groups/members can be dropped safely.

---

### üìè How to Check Redo Log Size (MB)

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, BYTES/1024/1024 AS SIZE_MB FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Redo Log Multiplexing ‚Äì Practical Steps (for ORADB)

---

### üîç Step 1: Validate Existing Redo Log Members

```bash
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

üëÅÔ∏è Confirm redo logs exist under `/u01/oradata/ORADB`.

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

### üìÅ Step 2: Create Directory for New Members

```bash
mkdir -p /u02/oradata/ORADB
```

üèóÔ∏è This will act as the **second disk location** for new members.

---

### ‚ûï Step 3: Add New Members to Each Group

```bash
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

```sql
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo01b.log' TO GROUP 1;
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo02b.log' TO GROUP 2;
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo03b.log' TO GROUP 3;
```

‚úÖ Now each group is **mirrored**: 1 file in `/u01`, 1 in `/u02`

---

### üßæ Step 4: Verify All Redo Members Are Added

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

Confirm that each group has members in both `/u01` and `/u02`.

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

## üóëÔ∏è Drop Old Redo Log Members

---

### üîç Step 5.1: Check Log Group Statuses

```bash
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

üéØ Identify groups with `INACTIVE` status.

---

### üîÉ Step 5.2: Switch Logs to Make Groups INACTIVE (If Needed)

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM CHECKPOINT;
```

üîÅ Re-check until the **targeted group becomes `INACTIVE`**:

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

---

### üß† Step 5.3: Identify Which Members to Drop

Run:

```sql
SELECT L.GROUP#, L.MEMBER, LG.STATUS
FROM V$LOGFILE L
JOIN V$LOG LG ON L.GROUP# = LG.GROUP#
WHERE L.MEMBER LIKE '/u01/oradata/ORADB/%';
```

‚úÖ Only members from `INACTIVE` groups can be dropped.

---

### ‚ùå Step 5.4: Drop Old Redo Log Members from `/u01`

```sql
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo01a.log';
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo02a.log';
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo03a.log';
```

> üö´ Skip any member that still belongs to a `CURRENT` or `ACTIVE` group.

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

### üßπ Step 5.5: Remove Physical Files at OS Level

```bash
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo01a.log
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo02a.log
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo03a.log
```

üìÅ Oracle **does not** delete physical redo log files automatically.

| 4      | Verify new members are added correctly            |
| 5.1    | Check if log groups are `INACTIVE`                |
| 5.2    | Force switches + checkpoint to make them inactive |
| 5.3    | Query members that belong to `INACTIVE` groups    |
