## üîÅ Redo Log Multiplexing

---

### üìò What Are Redo Logs?

Redo logs store **all changes made to the database**, helping in **instance recovery** in case of crash or failure. These are critical for **data durability and integrity**.

---

### üßæ What Redo Logs Contain:

Redo logs capture **every change made to data** at a **low level**, such as:

* üìù **DML changes**:
  `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` ‚Äî before/after image of modified rows
* üîß **DDL operations**:
  `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER INDEX`, etc.
* üß± **Undo data**:
  Rollback data needed to reverse uncommitted transactions
* üì¶ **Transaction control**:
  Marks for `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`
* üîÑ **Data dictionary changes**:
  Updates to system metadata like table/user definitions
* üìö **Temporary tablespace activity** (during recovery if used)

> ‚úÖ Redo logs **do NOT record `SELECT` statements** ‚Äî only **modifications** to data

---

### üß© Redo Log Structure

* A **Redo Log Group** = one or more **Redo Log Members**
* Each **group** is written **in parallel** to all its members
* Oracle reuses groups in **circular fashion** üîÑ

> ‚ùóRedo logs are **vital for crash recovery**. Keeping them on a single disk = single point of failure!

---

### üîÑ Circular Working Mechanism

    style C fill:#fbeee6,stroke:#d35400,stroke-width:2px
```

üåÄ Oracle continuously **cycles through redo log groups**:
It writes to `CURRENT`, then switches to the next group in the sequence.

---

### üîí Why Multiplex Redo Logs?

To avoid **data loss or corruption** in case of disk or file failures.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Multiplexing:

* ‚úÖ Reduces chance of losing redo data
* ‚úÖ Continues operation even if one member is corrupted
* ‚úÖ Oracle recommends it in **all production environments**

### üß† Redo Log Statuses (`V$LOG`)

| Status     | Meaning                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `CURRENT`  | Group actively being written to üü¢             |
| `ACTIVE`   | Still needed for recovery, not reusable yet üü° |
| `INACTIVE` | Archived and **safe to drop** ‚ö´                |

üîç Check log group statuses:

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only `INACTIVE` groups/members can be dropped safely**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Redo Log Multiplexing ‚Äì Practical Steps (for ORADB)

---

### üîç Step 1: Validate Existing Redo Log Members

Connect to SQL\*Plus:

```bash
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

Run:

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE ORDER BY GROUP#;
EXIT;
```

üëÅÔ∏è Check if redo log members currently exist under `/u01/oradata/ORADB`.

---

### üìÅ Step 2: Create Directory for New Members

If not already present:

```bash
mkdir -p /u02/oradata/ORADB
```

üèóÔ∏è This will act as the **second disk location** for new members.

---

### ‚ûï Step 3: Add New Members to Each Group

```bash
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

```sql
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo01b.log' TO GROUP 1;
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo02b.log' TO GROUP 2;
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER '/u02/oradata/ORADB/redo03b.log' TO GROUP 3;
```

‚úÖ Now each group is **mirrored**: 1 file in `/u01`, 1 in `/u02`

---

### üßæ Step 4: Verify All Redo Members Are Added

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

Confirm that each group has members in both directories (`/u01` and `/u02`).

---

## üóëÔ∏è Drop Old Redo Log Members 

---

### üîç Step 5.1: Check Log Group Status

```sql
SELECT GROUP#, STATUS FROM V$LOG ORDER BY GROUP#;
```

üéØ Look for **`INACTIVE`** groups ‚Äî only those are eligible for dropping.

---

### üîÉ Step 5.2: Switch Logs to Make Groups INACTIVE (If Needed)

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
ALTER SYSTEM CHECKPOINT;
```

üîÅ Repeat the query until the targeted group becomes `INACTIVE`.

---

### ‚ùå Step 5.3: Drop Old Redo Log Members from `/u01` (If INACTIVE)

```sql
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo01a.log';
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo02a.log';
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER '/u01/oradata/ORADB/redo03a.log';
EXIT;
```

üö´ Do **NOT** drop members from `CURRENT` or `ACTIVE` groups.

---

### üßπ Step 5.4: Remove Physical Files (Manually at OS Level)

```bash
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo01a.log
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo02a.log
rm /u01/oradata/ORADB/redo03a.log
```

üìÅ Oracle **does not** delete the file automatically.

### üìå Summary Table

| ‚úÖ Step | Description                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Check current redo members via `V$LOGFILE`        |
| 2      | Create new directory `/u02/oradata/ORADB`         |
| 3      | Add members to each group                         |
| 4      | Verify new members are added correctly            |
| 5.1    | Check if log groups are `INACTIVE`                |
| 5.2    | Force switches + checkpoint to make them inactive |
| 5.3    | Drop old members from `/u01`                      |
| 5.4    | Manually remove old redo files from disk          |
